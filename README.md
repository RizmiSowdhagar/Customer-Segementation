# Customer-Segementation
Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share
similar characteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unsatisfied
customer needs. Using the above data companies can then outperform the competition by
developing uniquely appealing products and services. Customer Segmentation is a popular
application of unsupervised learning. Using clustering, identify segments of customers to target
the potential user base. They divide customers into groups according to common characteristics
like gender, age, interests, and spending habits so they can market to each group effectively.
Then analyze their annual incomes and spending scores. Using clustering techniques, companies
can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base. In
this, we will make use of K-means clustering which is the essential algorithm for clustering
unlabeled dataset and also visualize the gender and age distributions. Then, an assessment of
changes over several periods of time is carried out. The originality of this research lies in its
incorporation of time and trend of customer value changes in improving the accuracy of
predictions based on the past behavior of customers.
# Challenge
Customer Segmentation is a popular application of unsupervised learning. Using
clustering, identify segments of customers to target the potential user base. They divide
customers into groups according to common characteristics like gender, age, interests,
and spending habits so they can market to each group effectively.
Use K-means clustering and also visualize the gender and age distributions. Then
analyze their annual incomes and spending scores.
# Algorithm Used

# Data
The data includes the following features:
1. Customer ID
2. Customer Gender
3. Customer Age
4. Annual Income of the customer (in Thousand Dollars)
5. Spending score of the customer (based on customer behaviour and spending nature)
Size of the dataset
# Conclusion
K means clustering is one of the most popular clustering algorithms and usually the first
thing practitioners apply when solving clustering tasks to get an idea of the structure of
the dataset. The goal of K means is to group data points into distinct non-overlapping
subgroups. One of the major application of K means clustering is segmentation of
customers to get a better understanding of them which in turn could be used to increase
the revenue of the company.
